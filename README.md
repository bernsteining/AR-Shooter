# AR Shooter Galaxy

TL;DR : [demo](https://youtu.be/lT-G-6cexD4)

AR Shooter Galaxy is an Augmented Reality game made with Unity and ARKit, available on iOS.

Once you've selected an horizontal plane (detected by ARKit) to play, a portal will breach out and random objects will spawn from it. Your goal is to shoot the objects as fast as you can in order to get the highest score. But be careful, all objects aren't worth to shoot! Each game has a duration of 60 seconds.

### Game Mechanics:

Clocks: Time goes 2 times slower, time for combos!
TNT: You lose twice as much points you would have won by hitting another object. Avoid shooting TNT !
Score: If your score becomes negative because you shot a TNT, Game Over.
